This is a fork of the memrise turbo script by infofarmer. It includes the following tweaks:
- better IME support - e.g. when inputting chinese characters, the input is only tested once you've finished composing the word (i.e. not when still selecting the character(s) from the ime options)
- re-allow pausing
- skip the extra next required when choosing mems
- certain characters (·；;) will clear the input - useful when issues with IME cause old inputs to require clearing

===========================

Memrise Turbo advances to the next question as soon as you finish
typing the correct answer, without any delays or even the need for you
to press Enter.  Ever. It enables you to water your items at the speed
of your fingers.

It works for all types of questions — no more pauses.
