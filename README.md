MemriseForgiveTypos.user.js
===========================

### Description

Shows an alert box ***once*** if the [Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) of a given answer and the correct answer is 1 or 2.

I'm not a big fan of making a hack like this but at the same time I don't think you should be punished for accidental typos as Memrise currently does. Use at your own peril.
